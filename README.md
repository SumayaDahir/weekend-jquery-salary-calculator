# Jquery Salary Calculator

[Project Instructions](./INSTRUCTIONS.md), this line may be removed once you have updated the README.md

## Description

Create an application that records employee salaries and adds salaries up to report monthly costs. 
The application should have an input form that collects _employee first name, last name, ID number, job title, annual salary_.

A 'Submit' button should collect the form information, store the information to calculate monthly costs, append information to the DOM and clear the input fields. Using the stored information, calculate monthly costs and append this to the to DOM. If the total monthly cost exceeds $20,000, add a red background color to the total monthly cost.

Create a delete button that removes an employee from the DOM. For Base mode, it does **not** need to remove that Employee's salary from the reported total..
